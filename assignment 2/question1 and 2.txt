Q1 what is github? write a simple definition of github?

ANS:-GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code.
It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking,
software feature requests, task management, continuous integration etc

Q2 How can you clone a GitHub repository to your local machine? Provide the
command and explain each part of it.

ANS:-Certainly! Cloning a GitHub repository to your local machine is a common task, especially when you want to work on the code locally.
Here's the command and an explanation of each part:

1.) Git clone: This is the command you use to clone a repository in Git. It tells Git that you want to create a copy of the repository on your local machine.

2.) <repository_URL>: This is the URL of the repository you want to clone. You can find this URL on the GitHub repository's page.
It typically looks like https://github.com/username/repository.git. This URL tells Git where to find the repository online.

When you run this command, Git will create a directory with the same name as the repository (unless you specify a different name), 
download all of the files and commit history from the repository, and set up a connection to the original repository called origin. 
This allows you to pull in changes from the original repository and push your changes back to it if you have permission.
